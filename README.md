**Disclaimer!**
The mod menu is not open-sourced, and most likely will never be, but it **is** **deobfuscated** so if you would like to view the source-code just to see my code, or to check the menu isn't malware, use a tool like **DnSpy**.

By no means are you allowed to use my code without permission, send me a message in my discord server, and I will probably say yes.
